EmotionRecognition
====================
Emotion recognition from text
## Introduction
* Topic: To recognize emotion from text
* Tasks
  * Pre-processing
  * Feature extraction
  * Classification

> Implement various kinds of classifiers with various methods and evaluate.
> * **Consider pre-processing** with Morphological analysis, emoticon, punctuation mark, etc.
> * **Consider feature extractor** with Word count, TFIDF, phrase(with polarity), etc.
> * **Implement various classifiers.** - Naïve Bayes, MaxEnt, SVM, deep learning(RNN, CNN)

## Requirements
* This program must be able to detect emotion from text.
* The program will include 7 kinds of emotion - Love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, fear and neutral.
* A text must be classified by one kind of emotion(most likely emotion).

## Project Schedule
* Information Gathering & Understanding the Topic (3/6 ~ )
* Identify research topics - the definition of emotions (academic research), etc.
  1. Study Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
  2. Study Python
  3. Read related articles
* Requirements Analysis (3/14 ~ 3/15)
* Set Direction of Research and Design (3/15 ~ 4/1)
* Simple Implementation (4/1 ~ 4/6)
  * Build emotion data set ver.1
  * Implement simple Naïve Bayes classifier
  * Evaluate performance with 5-fold cross validation
  * Study how to crawl tweets
* Implementation
  * Classifiers
    1. Naïve Bayes
    2. MaxEnt (4/13 ~ 4/19)
    3. SVM (4/20 ~ 4/26)
    4. Deep learning(RNN, CNN) (4/27 ~ 5/15)
  * Consider pre-processing with
    * Morphological analysis, emoticon, punctuation mark, etc. (4/13 ~ 4/26)
  * Consider feature extractor with
    * Word count, TFIDF, phrase(with polarity), etc. (4/27 ~ 5/15)
  * Testing and debugging (5/15 ~ 5/26)
    1. Evaluate performance
    2. Additional data collection and improvement
    3. Final performance evaluation
  * Poster presentation to the CSE professors and students (6/2)
  * Demo and submitting final report (6/2)
